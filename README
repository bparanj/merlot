SEO Starter Guide

1) The <title> tag should be placed within the <head> tag of the HTML document. Ideally, create a unique title for each page on your site. Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content. Use brief, but descriptive titles - DONE

2) The title for your homepage can list the name of your business and could include other information like the physical location of the business, its main offerings etc.

3) A page's description meta tag is a sentence or two or a short paragraph. [DONE]
The description meta tag is placed within the <head> tag of your HTML document.
Write a description that would both inform and interest users if they saw your description meta tag as a snippet in a search result. You could automatically generate description meta tags based on each page's content. [PENDING - Categories]

4) Creating descriptive categories and filenames for the documents on your website. Also, it can create easier, "friendlier" URLs.

5) Prepare two sitemaps: one for users, one for search engines. A site map is a simple page on your site that displays the structure of your website, and usually consists of a hierarchical listing of the pages on your site. Visitors may visit this page if they are having problems finding pages on your site. 

An XML Sitemap file, which you can submit through Google's Webmaster Tools, makes it easier for Google to discover the pages on your site. Sitemap Generator Script helps you create a Sitemap file for your site. To learn more Webmaster Help Center provides a useful guide.

6) Create a simple directory structure. Use a directory structure that organizes your content well and makes it easy for visitors to know where 
they're on your site. Try using your directory structure to indicate the type of content found at that URL.

7) Allow for the possibility of a part of the URL being removed.
